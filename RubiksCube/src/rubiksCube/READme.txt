My project is basically a Rubik's Cube program that has 3 different features.

The first feature is a Rubik's Cube scramble generator.
During official speed-cubing competitions (where so-called speedcubers compete to see who can solve a Rubik's Cube the fastest), they use computer generated
algorithms to scramble the puzzle to ensure that every one is scrambled properly and fairly. My program is  able to output numerous algorithms by which an
individual can scramble their cube.

The second feature is a Rubik's Cube simulator.
The user is given a virtual Rubik's Cube that they can perform various moves on, from single layer turns and rotations to double layer turns and middle layer turns.

The third and final feature is a Rubik's Cube solver.
The user can input a scrambled cube into the program to solve. The program outputs every single move that it is doing, allowing the user to follow along.
It is important to note that some cube configurations are impossible to solve. Also, if one does not have a Rubik's Cube, it may be hard to input the values.

Here are some sample scrambled cubes you can input:

        O Y G 
        Y W W 
        W O Y 

B O G   R G B   R G Y   R R W 
R G G   R R W   O B B   W O W 
R B Y   O B Y   B B G   O G B 

        G R O 
        Y Y O 
        W Y W 
        
        
        
        B G W 
        R W Y 
        G O B 

Y Y Y   R W W   R O B   O W R 
B G B   W R G   O B O   B O Y 
O Y Y   B B W   R R G   Y W G 

        O R G 
        G Y G 
        W R O
